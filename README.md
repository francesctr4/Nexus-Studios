## Game Description

**Dragged Off Time** is an **action RPG** with Roguelike variants, designed and developed by **Nexus Studios** during the Project II subject of the Videogame Design and Development degree, taught at CITM UPC and supervised by [Pedro Omedas](https://github.com/pomedas).

Its setting is based on a virtual world with 4 different types of scenarios within it (in total there would be 5 types of scenarios), which are: prehistoric, medieval-magical, futuristic and apocalyptic.

Over the course of the journey of a university student named **Kleos**, players will find a wide variety of weapons, armour, and items in order to progress through enemy-filled dungeons, discover the meaning of that world and make their way back into the real world. Alive.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to escape alive from the time rift and return to the real world by traversing the various dungeons located in different time 
periods and reuniting all the temporal parts of the protagonist.
