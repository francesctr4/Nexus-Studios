## Game Description

**Dragged Off Time** is an **action RPG** with Roguelike variants, designed and developed by **Nexus Studios** during the Project II subject of the Videogame Design and Development degree, taught at CITM UPC and supervised by [Pedro Omedas](https://github.com/pomedas).

Its setting is based on a virtual world with 4 different types of scenarios within it (in total there would be 5 types of scenarios), which are: prehistoric, medieval-magical, futuristic and apocalyptic.

Over the course of the journey of a university student named **Kleos**, players will find a wide variety of weapons, armour, and items in order to progress through enemy-filled dungeons, discover the meaning of that world and make their way back into the real world. Alive.
